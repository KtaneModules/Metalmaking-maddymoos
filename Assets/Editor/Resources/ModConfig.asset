  description: 'A rare metal is a hard to obtain, very rare substance.

    It takes a lot of precision or luck to obtain.


    You have been provided a booklet, a goal, and 8 meteos we have deemed will be
    of enough quality to forge the Metal.


    We leave you to find the ingredients you need, and forge the metal.


    Good Luck.'
